# Colour Tool!

[See it here!](http://colours.frankieshrieves.co.uk/)

I came across [this awesome API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) and wanted to make an app which interacted with it.

You can pick a colour using [the tool](https://coloris.js.org/).

The app then shows you complimentary colours.

You can set the complimentary colour scheme.

And also copy different colour values to your clipboard.
